# Dinosaur and flappybird fitness game

### Part of the AI Fitness Trainer Project (25AACR06)

This game is a unique blend of fitness and fun — designed specifically to **keep your workout going, even when you're not in the mood for traditional exercises**.  
Instead of using a keyboard, your body becomes the controller! Thanks to real-time pose detection using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, you can **jump, squat, and move** to play the game.  

Whether you're dodging obstacles by squatting or jumping over hurdles in-game, you're still working out — all while having fun and staying active!

## How to Play

1. **Get Ready**  
   Make sure your webcam is on and you're visible in the frame. Stand at a comfortable distance for the system to detect your full body.

2. **Jump to Begin**  
   The game starts when you perform a jump. This action is detected using pose tracking.

3. **Play with Your Body**  
   - **Jump Up** to make the character jump over obstacles.  
   - **Squat Down** to make the character duck under flying obstacles.

4. **Stay Active**  
   Every movement counts! The game encourages **continuous motion** — turning your body into the game controller. This ensures you're **physically engaged throughout**, making it a fun alternative to workouts.

5. **Challenge Yourself**  
   Try to beat your high score while staying in motion. The longer you play, the more you move — and the more calories you burn!
