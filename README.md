## Abstract
<p align="left">      
GetUpGo is an AI-based fitness and posture correction system that uses real-time pose detection through a webcam to guide users while performing exercises or yoga poses. It provides instant feedback on posture accuracy, counts repetitions, and even allows users to play interactive motion-controlled games like Subway Surfers or the Dinosaur game based on body movements. The system helps users maintain correct form, avoid injury, and stay motivated during workouts.

```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the project
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 5: How it works
- The system activates your webcam and detects your real-time pose.  
- Choose between **Exercise Mode** and **Game Mode**.  
  - In **Exercise Mode**, perform workouts like **push-ups**, **planks**, **lunges**, or **yoga**.  
    - GetUpGo provides **live posture correction**, **rep counting**, and **calorie estimation**.  
  - In **Game Mode**, you can control games such as **Subway Surfers** or **Chrome Dinosaur** using your body movements.
